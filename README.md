### Kanboard configuration

1. Be sure that your users have an email address in their profiles
2. Assign a project identifier to the desired projects: **Project settings > Edit Project > Identifier**. The format has to be alphanumeric like `MYPROJECT`
3. Send an email to your project using the email subject `kanboard+MYPROJECT:TASKNAME`.
> **Attention**: The from address must be same as the email address in the user profile in Kanboard and the user must be member of the project.
4. Pull email by calling URL, which is found under **Settings > Integrations > PullMailTasks** along with
some other settings
5. *Optionally* set color, tag(s) and support for receiving attachments for all pulled tasks. Furthermore `kanboard+MYPROJECT:TASKNAME` as email subject with keyword `kanboard` is the default value for all pulled tasks. Alternatively, the keyword could be suspended completely. This may be useful, if the imap account is used only for pulling tasks. In this case, the necessary email subject could be changed to `MYPROJECT:TASKNAME`
